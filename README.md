Project Description: Text To Speech & Speech to Text Converter

This project offers a simple yet powerful tool for converting both text to speech and speech to text directly in your browser. With a clean and intuitive interface, users can effortlessly interact with the application.

Features:

Text to Speech Conversion: Users can input any text into the provided textarea and choose from a selection of available voices. By clicking the "Listen" button, the text will be spoken aloud using the chosen voice.

Speech to Text Conversion: Users can activate the speech recognition feature by clicking the "Start" button. Once activated, the application transcribes speech input into the adjacent textarea in real-time. The "Stop" button halts the speech recognition process.

Technologies Used:

HTML: Structuring the webpage layout and elements.
CSS: Styling the interface for a visually appealing look.
JavaScript: Handling text-to-speech and speech-to-text functionalities.
How It Works:

Text to Speech: Utilizes the Web Speech API to convert text input into speech. Users can select their preferred voice from the dropdown menu, and upon clicking the "Listen" button, the chosen text will be spoken.

Speech to Text: Employs the Web Speech Recognition API to transcribe spoken words into text. Users can click the "Start" button to activate speech recognition. As the user speaks, the recognized text is displayed in the textarea in real-time. The "Stop" button terminates the speech recognition process.

This project provides a convenient solution for users who need text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities, all within a web browser environment.
